# Finally, a command line shell for the 90s

## fish is a smart and user-friendly command line
shell for Linux, macOS, and the rest of the family.

I have become a big fan of the fish shell recently.  it has great developer ergonomics.  Little things like autopairing `"` and etc.  make working with it a breeze.

I don't recommend using it as a login shell.... but it's great to log in to whatever your system provides by default like zsh or bash, then I tell tmux to use fish for all the panes.

* https://github.com/jorgebucaran/awsm.fish another awsm list, but I am not sure why he won't even mention Oh My Fish
